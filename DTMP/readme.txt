This is DTMP (Don't Touch My Pizza).exe by anotheraccount (a harmless and destructive malware)
When you run this, it will open a youtube link to nyanwolf's music video!
Epilepsy Warning!
Also, never run this malware if you hate the song! (and don't harrass the creator)
Made in Dev C++, recompiled in Visual Studio 2022 by Executioner

Credit to zombycare for the song, and everyone else.
For Skidders: Please credit to me if you use the source code!

DTMP displays two message boxes when you execute it
so that you do not click it by accident and destroy your computer. Additionally, Windows versions Vista and later have a
User Account Control prompt to warn the user even further.
